Hello! My name is Austin, and I am currently studying LJST at Amherst College. I like to cook, hike and read in my free time. Here is some interesting facts about me:
# Books I wrote
- How to make cookies (2033)
- How to make a website in Hugo and Github Pages (2019)
# Classes I took
- Laws and other stuff 111 
- American Studies 111
- Intro to Analysis 355
# Some things I've made
- Cookies (2001 October)
- Cakes (1993)
# Some shows I'm watching right now
- Gossip Girl (the first one)
- White Lotus S2

I'm really smart and you should hire me. I will change your firm for the better and you would be lucky to have me.


You should download this new app I made called "Prison Escape" [here](https://google.com). Have a nice day :)
